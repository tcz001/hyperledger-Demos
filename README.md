# hyperledger-Demos

This is a repo to put some demo usage of Hyperledger framework.

We aim to provide this for reference when a new developer can easily start
to work on Hyperledger, and quickly prototype a live demo for analysis.


## Quick start

```
git clone https://github.com/tcz001/hyperledger-demo
cd hyperledger-demo/docker/
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```
